            <li>Align your back with the back of your chair to help maintain good posture.</li>
            <li>Relax your shoulders; they should not be rounded or hunched.</li>
            <li>Ensure that your ears are in line with your shoulders.</li>
            <li>Take regular breaks to stand up, stretch, and move around.</li>
        </ul>
