# cpsc484-posture-project-system

## Brief Description:
The Postural Analysis System is a final project developed for the CPSC 484 course. It aims to analyze and assess posture using computer vision techniques. The system detects key points in the human body to evaluate posture quality and provide feedback for corrective actions.

## Problem Space:
Poor posture can lead to various health issues such as back pain, fatigue, and musculoskeletal disorders. The project addresses the need for an automated system that can assist in evaluating and improving posture, especially in environments where prolonged sitting or standing is common.

## Installation Instructions:
1. Clone the project repository from the GitHub link.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. You're ready to use the Postural Analysis System!
(note: there are no dependencies that need to be installed in addition to our code)

## Deployment Environment Constraints:
**Firewall and Network:** Ensure that the system running the Postural Analysis System has network access to download required dependencies and access any external APIs or databases if needed.
**Resource Availability:** The system may require a computer with sufficient processing power, especially if real-time video analysis is involved.
**Browser Compatibility:** If the project includes a web interface or visualization component, ensure compatibility with common browsers used in your school's environment.
**Security Policies:** Verify that the deployment environment allows the execution of the necessary scripts and does not block connections to external resources required by the project.
